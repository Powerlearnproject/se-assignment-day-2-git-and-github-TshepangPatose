## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?

**Fundamental concepts of version control**
Version control is a system that keeps track of the changes made in a file over some time. It allows users to change to previous versions, collaborations and keeps the history of changes made.
**Why Github is a popular tool for merging versions of a code**
-It has collaboration features, where developers can work together on a project
-It backs up the repos in a cloud to prevent loss of projects
**How version control helps maintain project integrity**
-It records each change made in order to understand why the modification was made.
-It allows developers to collaborate on the same project
-It allows developers to revert to a stable version of the code, if a bug or some issue arises

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?

Step 1-Sign iinto GitHub account
Step 2-Create new repository (Click + for new repository, then click new)
Step 3-Write a repository name, add its description, then choose its visibility (private or public)
Step 4-Click create repository to finalize

**Decisions**
- Choose the visibility to be private/public
-Set the collaboration permission
-Choose if you want to share the project openly

## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
-It is the summary of what the project is all about
-It explains the installation, configuration and the usage of the project
-Gives guidelines for interested collaborators
**What should be included**
-The title and description of the project
-Installation and set up instructions
-User guide
-Collaborator's guidelines

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?

Public repository- Anyone on GitHub can view, fork and clone the repository
Advantages- Any developer can collaborate
          - The project's visibility can increase
          - Public repositories get free hosting on GitHub
Disadvantages- Collaborations cannot be controlled, which increases the risks of having spam collaborations

## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
